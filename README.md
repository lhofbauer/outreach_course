# Energy modelling outreach course

This is a first version of course material for teaching an outreach course on energy modelling in school. It has already been used to teach pupils aged 13-15. It includes a handbook, written in LaTeX and using the kaobook class, and spreadsheet-based energy models.

A lot of potential additions and improvements have already been identified, only a few of which are currently mentioned in the LaTeX files.
